## Usage Example


Source the JavaScript from this project within the `<head>` tags...


```html
<script src="BrowserStorage.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```


Initialize an instance of `BrowserStorage` and test that some form of client side storage is available...


```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  const storage = new BrowserStorage();

  if (storage.storage_available != true) {
    throw new Error('We may never have any memory of this...');
  }
</script>
```


The following methods are available to the `storage` instance;


- `storage_available`, property returning `boolean` of if storage was available during initialization.

- `supportsLocalStorage()`, use `storage.supports_local_storage` property instead within tests, unless it is expected that permissions will change before the next page load on the same domain.

- `supportsCookies()`, much like `supportsLocalStorage` use `storage.supports_cookies` instead within tests to avoid re-checking.

- `constructorRefresh()`, a copy of `constructor()` that may be called after initialization to refresh class properties.

- `get(key)`, returns `null` or value (may be `boolean`, `integer`, `float`, or `string`) associated with passed `key`

- `remove(key)`, returns `boolean` after removing values associated with passed `key`

- `set(key, value, days_to_live)`, associates `key` with `value` for a number of `days_to_live`

- `clear()`, removes all locally stored _`value`s_ from browser storage.


> Note, if/when this class falls-back to using cookies both `remove(key)` and `clear()` methods require a page refresh to also remove stored `key` names.
>
> And when this class is using `localStorage` then _`set`'s_ `days_to_live` is currently _meaningless_.
